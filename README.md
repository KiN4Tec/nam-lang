This is NOT intented for prouduction use,
this is just simple project for me to learn the Rust prgramming language.

Feel free to NOT submit an issue nor a pull request,
as i am trying to learn at my own pace and share what i have done to the world without any interruption.

In other words, this is a playground for me.

Cheers 🍒
