Numbers And Matrices Language

This is an octave-like language written in Rust.

This is NOT intented for prouduction use,
this is just simple project for me to learn the Rust prgramming language.

Feel free to NOT put an issue nor a pull request,
as i am trying to learn at my own pace and share what i have done to the world without any interruption.

In other words, this is a playground for me.

Note: The name is temporary and not finalized, yet.
