# ConVector

This is an octave-like syntax interpreter written in Rust.

This is NOT intented for prouduction use,
this is just simple project for me to learn the Rust prgramming language.

Feel free to NOT put an issue or a pull request,
i am trying to learn at my own pace and share what i have done to the world without any interruption.

Peace ✌️
